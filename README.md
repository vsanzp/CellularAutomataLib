# CellularAutomataLib

Cellular Automata Models in Modelica (version 3.0)

This library can be used to describe 1D, 2D and 3D cellular automata models in Modelica.
It also includes interface models to combine cellular automata with other Modelica models.
In order to automatically generate the graphical animations of the simulations the Raylib (www.raylib.com) library program has to be installed in the computer.
